And guess what! The third party has just deprecated the function:

third_party_dependency_that_changes_frequently()
so we can't use it anymore.

But it's OKâ€”they've replaced it with a new one:

third_party_dependency_that_changes_very_frequently()
Oh, and one more thing: the order of the arguments has changed:

third_party_dependency_that_changes_very_frequently(b, a, c)
That durned Third Party! This is the 15th time they've changed that function this year! And you just know they're going to do it again!

What to turn in
Your task is to modify the above code so that it:

Uses the new argument order.
Uses the new function name.
Is refactored so that the next time Third Party changes the function you only have to modify it in one place!
